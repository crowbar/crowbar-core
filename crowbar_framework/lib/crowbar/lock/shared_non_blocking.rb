  class Lock::SharedNonBlocking < Lock
    # This class implements a shared (i.e. non-exclusive) lock, by
    # default on a remote node.  It is used to allow one or more
    # concurrent proposal applications to temporarily pause any
    # intervallic runs triggered by the chef-client daemon, to prevent
    # them from interfering with the orchestration of the proposals
    # being applied:
    #
    #   https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=857375
    #
    # It has the same semantics as a shared read/write lock, except
    # that instead of readers reading, we have threads applying
    # proposals, and instead of a single writer writing, we have the
    # chef-client daemon triggering a chef-client run.
