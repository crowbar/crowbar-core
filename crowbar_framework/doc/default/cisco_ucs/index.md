# Cisco UCS

This barclamp communicates with a Cisco UCS Manager instance 
via its XML-based API server, and can perform the following 
functions:

* Instantiate UCS service profiles for SUSE Cloud compute and 
  storage nodes from predefined UCS service profile templates.
* Reboot and power up/down nodes.


## Prerequisites

* A Cisco UCS Manager server, or the UCS Platform Emulator
  (see below).
* In Ciscoâ€™s UCS Manager, it is necessary to create two 
  service profile templates called `suse-cloud-compute` 
  and `suse-cloud-storage`.  These names are case sensitive.


### `suse-cloud-compute` service profile template

This service profile template is to be used for preparing systems 
as SUSE Cloud compute nodes. Minimum requirements:

* 20GB storage
* 8GB RAM
* 1 NIC
* Processor supporting AMD-V or Intel-VT


### `suse-cloud-storage` service profile template

This service profile template is to be used for preparing systems 
as SUSE Cloud storage nodes.


### UCS administrator account

A user account must be created with administrative rights in the 
Cisco UCS Manager, and the barclamp will use the credentials of 
that account.

The account must have access to the above service profile templates,
and have authorization to create service profiles and associate 
them with physical hardware.


## Configuration

* Log in to the Crowbar admin interface: http://yourhost
* There should now be a tab labelled "UCS".
* Click the UCS tab. The settings screen will be opened where the
  following information needs to be entered.
    * URL - this should have the form of: http://ucsmanagerhost/nuova
    * Username & Password - credentials from the administrator account
      described above.


## Usage

* Click the UCS tab in the Crowbar admin interface.
* Identify the servers to be used for compute or storage, select the servers,
  select the action and click the update button.  This action may take many
  minutes to fully complete.  
* To refresh the screen, click the UCS tab (or Dashboard sub-menu item).


## Troubleshooting

All troubleshooting should be done within the Cisco UCS Manager interface.


## Testing with the UCS Platform Emulator

The UCS Platform Emulator can be [downloaded from Cisco's
website](http://developer.cisco.com/web/unifiedcomputing/ucsemulatordownload)
after registering for a free account.  This barclamp has been tested
with version 2.1(2aPE1) of the emulator.  However at the time of writing, 
the emulator does not honour power commands, so do not expect this 
functionality to work.

The Emulator was designed to run as a VMware virtual machine.
However, it has been shown to work fine as an `x86_64` VM running
under KVM on openSUSE 12.3, with `.vmdk` file as a separate disk
device, and 3 `pcnet` virtual interfaces configured on the same
network as the Crowbar admin node.
