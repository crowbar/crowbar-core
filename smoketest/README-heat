Smoketest workflow:
1. Smoketest script seeks ".json" and ".yaml" files in a smoketest directory and interprets them as CFN (.json files)  and HOT (.yaml files) stack templates.
2. If any templates are found, script authorizes itself to work in a cloud and calculates any data required as input for further actions.
3. CFN stack execution and verification of it both by querying stack state through heat-client and by pinging VM deployed during stack execution.
4. HOT stack  execution and verification of it both by querying stack state through heat-client and by pinging VM deployed during stack execution.
5. Triggering stacks deletion through heat-client.
6. Cleanup.
