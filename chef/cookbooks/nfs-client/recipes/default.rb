### Prepare data about NFS mounts we'll handle

node[:nfs_client][:exports].each do |name, data|
  # remove trailing slashes, as remounting fails when there are some
  mount_path = data[:mount_path].sub(/\/+$/, "")
  nfs_server = data[:nfs_server]
  export = data[:export]
  raw_options = data[:mount_options]

  nfs_mount = "#{nfs_server}:#{export}"
  if raw_options.nil?
    raw_options = []
  end

  ## Rework options
  options = []
  raw_options.each do |option|
    split_options = option.split(",")
    options.concat(split_options)
  end

  # Force nofail option
  unless options.include?("nofail")
    options << "nofail"
  end
  # Add comment option (and remove other comment options)
  options = options.select { |option| not option.start_with?("comment=") }
  options << comment_option

  ## Some checks
  if nfs_mounts.key?(nfs_mount)
    raise "NFS mount \"#{nfs_mount}\" is defined multiple times."
  end
  if mount_paths.key?(mount_path)
    raise "Mount path \"#{mount_path}\" is used by several NFS mounts."
  end

  nfs_mounts[nfs_mount] = [mount_path, options]
  mount_paths[mount_path] = nfs_mount
end

### Check the existing state

# Ideally, we'd use something from chef, but it seems there's nothing to list
# existing mounts. Therefore, we use code inspired from
# https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/10-stable/chef/lib/chef/provider/mount/mount.rb

::File.foreach("/etc/fstab") do |line|

        mode 0755
        action :create
        recursive true
      end
    end
  end

  if need_remount.include?(nfs_mount)
    # NFS doesn't support the remount option, so manual umount :/
    # Also we need to disable/reenable to save options because
    # Chef::Provider::Mount doesn't resave if only options are different.
    mount "Temporarily removing mount before configuring back due to changed options: #{nfs_mount} -> #{mount_path}" do

    end
  end

    options options
    dump 0

  end
end
