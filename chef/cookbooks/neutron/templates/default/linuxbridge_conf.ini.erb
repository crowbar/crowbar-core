[vlans]
# (StrOpt) Type of network to allocate for tenant networks. The
# default value 'local' is useful only for single-box testing and
# provides no connectivity between hosts. You MUST change this to
# 'vlan' and configure network_vlan_ranges below in order for tenant
# networks to provide connectivity between hosts. Set to 'none' to
# disable creation of tenant networks.
#
# tenant_network_type = local
# Example: tenant_network_type = vlan
# NOTE(rhafer): tenant_network_type is no longer used for ml2. The option is now
# in ml2_conf.ini section [ml2] (on the neutron-server node)

# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>[:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max>] tuples enumerating ranges
# of VLAN IDs on named physical networks that are available for
# allocation. All physical networks listed are available for flat and
# VLAN provider network creation. Specified ranges of VLAN IDs are
# available for tenant network allocation if tenant_network_type is
# 'vlan'. If empty, only local networks may be created.

# network_vlan_ranges =
# Example: network_vlan_ranges = physnet1:1000:2999
# NOTE(rhafer): network_vlan_ranges is no longer used for ml2. The option is now

[linux_bridge]
# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>:<physical_interface> tuples mapping physical
# network names to the agent's node-specific physical network
# interfaces to be used for flat and VLAN networks. All physical
# networks listed in network_vlan_ranges on the server should have
# mappings to appropriate interfaces on each agent.

# (BoolOpt) Flag to enable l2population extension. This option should be used
# in conjunction with ml2 plugin l2population mechanism driver (in that case,
# both linuxbridge and l2population mechanism drivers should be loaded).
# It enables plugin to populate VXLAN forwarding table, in order to limit
# the use of broadcast emulation (multicast will be turned off if kernel and
